# Oxide.js Docs

Welcome to the home of Oxide!

## What is Oxide?

Oxide is a Svelte and TypeScript web framework for building full-stack applications. Use Svelte to build rich user interfaces, and Oxide will provide building blocks for the server side of your application.

It brings you sane defaults that you can adjust or remove to fit your needs. All of that provided to you, so you can focus on building and deploying your application.

## Documentation Structure

The docs are made up of several sections, each covering a specific aspect of Oxide. These sections include:

- **Getting Started**: A guide to setting up and running your first Oxide application.
- **Guides**: A guide to setting up and running your first Oxide application.
- **API Reference**: Detailed documentation on the Oxide API.

Use the sidebar to navigate or click slash (/) to search for a specific topic.

## Prerequisite

The design ideology of Oxide is to always try to stay as close to the original, "Vanilla" JavaScript as possible. Therefore, it's best for you to be familiar with:

- HTML
- CSS (and Tailwind CSS)
- TypeScript
- Svelte

If you are new to Svelte, we recommend checking out the [Basic Svelte](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte/welcome-to-svelte) to get started.
